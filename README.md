# Access Control System

This is the repository containing the software components that
were developed by Group 7.

This project consists of developing an Access Control System that allows us to control access to restricted areas through a User Identification Number - UIN.

The development of this project was entirely done during the second semester of the 2022/2023 school year at ISEL Engineering School (Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa).
